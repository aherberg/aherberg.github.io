                <div class="content">
                    <p>Iâ€™m Anders, a PNW native located in Seattle, WA. Currently I'm a UX Design Intern at Heali. Iâ€™m also a graduate student at the University of Washington studying Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE).</p>
                    <p>After completing a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from UW, I went on to complete a Masters of Education in Education Policy. After graduating, I stumbled into recruiting and worked for a few companies, including Amazon and Facebook. At Facebook, I supported Product Design teams and it confirmed my passion for design and making it my profession, leading to my decision to apply for UWâ€™s HCDE program.</p>
                    <p>Since pursuing a career in design, Iâ€™ve found that I care about working on projects that help people lead more sustainable lives via digital products. I discovered I do my best when working on projects end-to-end, distributing my responsibilities across research, design, and prototyping. Even more, designing products where I get to collaborate with users and the people affected by my design has been extremely rewarding.</p>
                    <p>Life isnâ€™t all about work, though, so when Iâ€™m not in front of a computer screen, Iâ€™m spending time with my dog, Ollie, or tinkering with something. Lately, Iâ€™ve been commissioned to design custom action figures for friends and clients â€” Iâ€™ve also taken on furniture building and fixing up my dream car, a Volvo C30.</p>
