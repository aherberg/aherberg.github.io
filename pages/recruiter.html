            <p>LinkedIn Recruiter redesign concept.</p>

            </header>
            
            <ul>
                <li><b>Role:</b> Product / Visual / UX Designer</li>
                <li><b>Time:</b> May 2019 - Jun 2019</li>
                <li><b>Project Type:</b> Design Exercise, Mockup</li>
            </ul>

            <p>LinkedIn is professional networking platform in the world. <b id="recruiter">LinkedIn Recruiter</b> is a subscription-based product that gives recruiters the ability to source from within LinkedIn's talent network.</p>

            // Hero Image //

            <p>For this design exercise, I decided to redesign LinkedIn's Recruiter mobile application to better match their flagship application and focus more on the services that a recuiter, like me, would use it for.</p>
            
            // IMAGES? //

            <p>As a former recruiter, I used LinkedIn Recruiter to discover and connect with talent. Primarily, I accessed Recruiter through desktop, but occasionally used the mobile application to have quick access to messages I would recieve from prospective candidates.</p>

            <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
            
            <p>Leveraging my own issues with the Recruiter mobile app, I redesigned the app to be more similar to a product like Messenger, which focuses on the messaging functionality only, whereas the existing Recruiter application allows you to view profiles and create folders or projects. Doing those things on a mobile device was too stressful for me, so I decided to keep the app WAY simpler.</p>
            
            // APP IMAGES //
            
            <h2>Messaging</h2>
            
            The original messaging experience was clunky in Recruiter, and made it difficult to have a natural conversational flow. There were no message threads, just an inbox of individual messages that were part of a larger thread. I decided to fix this by making it a message thread format instead.
            
            // BEFORE AFTER //
            
            <h2>Final Product</h2>
            
            <p>The final productly, mostly, recreated the look and feel of LinkedIn's messaging experience on their mobile app. Shapes, placements, and colors were all taken from the LinkedIn app to make it a smooth transition from one app to the other. Moreover, this was a great exercise for me to learn design tools and observe how popular apps layout their interfaces.</p>
