                <p>In partnership with Crunchbase.com, my team and I evaluated the information architecture of <a href="https://support.crunchbase.com/hc/en-us">Crunchbase’s Knowledge Center</a>&ndash;their self-service support site. There’s little data assessing the efficacy of user experiences of the Knowledge Center and its navigation logic. Because of this, we investigated if the intended purpose of the Knowledge Center achieves its goal to provide an efficient product to help users understand Crunchbase’s services and offerings.</p>

                <p>The project concluded with a presentation to Crunchbase’s Customer Experience (CX) team. You can view our final presentation <a href="/assets/documents/crunchPreso.pdf">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>Broad, ambiguous terminologies made it difficult for users to understand an article’s context, so they relied on keywords to guide their decision. For this article, there was a clear disconnect. In the Knowledge Center, it is located in the <b>“Get to know Crunchbase”</b> category, however, users associated the article with <b>User Data &amp; Privacy</b> and <b>Crunchbase Data Partners.</b></p>

                    <h4>02. Article: “How much does Crunchbase cost?”</h4>
                
                    <p>Similar to the article about data, the article about Crunchbase’s general cost required more critical thinking from participants. The article is curently located in the “Get to know Crunchbase” category, however, users expressed multiple options that seemed relevant to the question: Payments &amp; Billing, Pro Subscription, Enterprise Subscription, and Get to know Crunchbase. The most common error was participants defaulting to Payments &amp; Billing because they associated “cost” with “payments”.</p>

                    <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
                    
                    <p>To further visualize our findings, we created an affinity map <b>to better understand participants’ mental models and patterns in behavior</b>. We identified patterns through <b>quotes and observed reactions</b> the users displayed during the tree test.</p>

                <h2>Design Recommendations</h2>
                
                <p>Based on our study, we recommended that the Customer Experience team should develop <b>Crunchbase-specific terminologies</b> to reduce the use of vague, or broad, wording (i.e. “data”, “integration”, or “cost”). Specific terminologies could help users differentiate the content of an article based on the title.</p>

                <p>Additionally, we suggested that certain topics are “bundled” together rather than having separate categories which caused overlap and redundancies. Most importantly, <b>a category covering all subscriptions</b> rather than individually since users had a difficult time understanding the differences in subscriptions and pricing.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                
                <p>This study had plenty of limitations. Aside from the obvious (COVID pandemic and 100% remote communication), <b>remote interviews restricted our ability to analyze physical behavior in participants</b>. Another limitation was the depth of the study as well; we only tested the Knowledge Center via a simulator and <b>never had the chance to test users’ behavior on the actual site</b>. Using the actual site would have made for an entirely different discoverability exercise since the actual Knowledge Center has a search bar and more appealing layout than a basic list of items. </p>

                    <h2>Learnings</h2>
                    <p>For this study, I would have approached the problem differently and focused more on the article titles and how people perceived them as well as making sure they were categorized logically. I learned that <b>there needs to be diversity in data points</b> because our study only painted a small portion of a larger problem to be solved, which may have been due to our methods. I also learned the importance of <b>screening participants to protect data integrity</b>.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, as a team lead, I learned a lot about how to organize and prioritize a project. I learned it is just as important to <b>make sure everyone is on the same page</b> as it is to make sure you're adhering to a restricted timeline. Gaps in communication can set you back weeks if not done efficiently.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What's Next?</h3>
                    <p>When presenting our study, we suggested that next steps for the CX team should be evaluating the content of articles, as well as doing a thorough competitive analysis to better understand how their competitors are helping their users via self-service support pages.</p>
