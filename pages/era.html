                <h1>ERA Rebranding</h1>
                <p>New visual system for a non-profit.</p>
            </header>

            <p>In my HCDE 508 class, I was tasked with the rebranding for a non-profit client: The Electronic Reusing Association (ERA). My challenge was to create a new web layout and styleguide for the organization.</p>

            <h2>The Client</h2>
            
            <p>The Electronic Reusing Association (ERA) is a non-profit organization focused on the reduction of e-waste and providing communities with affordable electronics. They are headquartered in Canada, but have expanded to include locations across the USA.</p>

            <p>The ERA‚Äôs vision is to rethink e-waste as an opportunity to recover unwanted IT euipment, refurbish donated electronics to prepare them for reuse. The refurbished equipment is then donated to organizations and programs within the community.</p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>

            <p>After further researching the ERA's brnad and history, I created a moodboard to define the key themes for the rebrand. Next, I jumped into defining core components such as Typography, Grid Systems, Logos, and Color Palettes.
                
            // THUMBNAILS //
                
            <h2>Logo</h2>
            
            <p>The ERA‚Äôs logo was inspired by its commitment to recover, refurbish, and reuse unwanted IT equipment. The combination of letter- and abstract marks for the logo help convey symbolism for the ERA‚Äôs three ‚Äúr‚Äôs‚Äù (recover, refurbish, reuse). The r‚Äôs are symbolized in the three squares of the logo, with each square placed on top of another to signify the impact they represent.</p>
                
            // LOGO IMAGES //

            <h2>Channels</h2>

            <p>To implement my new branding, I incorporated my visual sysyems into the ERA's website, a mobile responsive website, and a moving van because one of the ERA's primary functions is to pickup and deliver recylced electronics. This channel seemed both appropriate and way for the ERA to get their brand more visibility.</p>

            <h2>Imagery</h2>

            <p>Throughout this project, I was most proud of the imagery I chose for the website. To truly express the journey of the ERA, I felt that illustrations would best describe and convey those points. For this, I designed and created custom illustrations to align directly with the ERA's messaging rather than opting for stock images.</p>
