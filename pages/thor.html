            <p>I took an assignment from my Norwegian 103 class way beyond its requirements. I always wanted to produce a cartoon and thought this would be a great opportunity since the script was already written!</p>

            // Hero Image //

            <p>The script of the story is based on an old Norse Mythology story where Thor lost his hammer. I took this story and reimagined it as if it were an episode of "Adventure Time", and used that illustrative style to inspire my drawings and characters.</p>
            
            // IMAGES? //

            <p>To bring my drawings to life, I scanned them into Photoshop, added color, and then created a series of images where I super-imposed various mouth-shapes.</p>

            // ILLUSTRATIONS //
            
            <p>I then took the images and did a stop-animation style movie in iMovie to come up with the final cartoon. I also wrote and recorded a fun theme song to uphold the feel of Adventure Time in the final product.</p>
