                <p>To investigate the problem, we used a mixed-methods approach to determine the severity of user concerns. We began with a heuristic evaluation of the current KC, then recruited participants to complete a card sorting activity to determine the mental mapping of the KCâ€™s categories and articles.

                <p>After our team presented our findings to the CX team, they took our results into consideration and implemented some of our recommendations into the KCâ€™s design updates. This included the incorporation of visual elements to simplify sections, breaking the landing page into chunks rather than a list of items, and incorporating a static FAQs section on the landing page that allows users to quickly access common inquiries.</p>
                <p>If I were to continue on this project, <b>I would want to dive deeper into user habits when communicating with customer support for more data related to concerns</b> as well as testing the actual KC page as we were limited to only testing information architecture via card sort and treejack exercises. I would also like to gather support call/chat recordings and transcripts to target specific pain points and learn more about which user personas rely on Crunchbaseâ€™s customer support team to resolve issues.</p>
