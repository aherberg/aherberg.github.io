            <h1>Lawn.mo</h1>
            <p>Find landscapers instantly.</p>

                <li><b>Role:</b> Product / Visual / UX Designer</li>

            </ul>

            <p><b id="lawnmo">Lawn.mo</b> is a mobile app that helps you find and hire contractors your landscaping projects. It's like if Angie's List and Lyft decided to go into business together.</p>

            // Hero Image //

            <p>I was interested in mobile app design and learning design tools, so I created a mockup for an app I came up with.</p>
            
            // IMAGES //

            <p>Lawn.mo would let homeowners, or anyone with the need for a landscapers, find private contractors to do anything from planting some flowers to mowing a lawn. Additionally, it can serve as a tool that homeowners can use to make sure the contractors they hire are professional and reliable.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            
            <p>For fun, I did some competitve analysis to learn about similar apps and get some inspiration for my own designs. I looked at apps like TaskRabbit for its primary functions to help users find people to do odd-jobs, and services like Lyft where you rely and trust the "contractors" and have a system to hold them accountable for their services.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            
            <p>I used this exercise to learn about styleguides and how to select and define typograpy, color palettes, and iconography.</p>
            
            // STYLES //
            
            <h2>Onboarding</h2>
            
            <p>Later on in my design, I decided to incorporate an onboarding experience to my design. I chose to help and contractors get the best out of their experience by creating detailed user profiles. The information shared in user profiles would be used to better identify and match contractors with properties they are equipped to handle and have positive reviews.</p>

            <h3>Integrations</h3>

            <p>Lastly, while I designing the onboarding process, I thought more about the information users were providing and how some of it could be time consuming to enter. To alleviate that, I thouught it would be helpful to incorporate an integration with comnpanies like Zillow where users can find their property in Zillow and quickly sync it to their Lawn.mo profile.</p>
