                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>One day, I saw a post on Imgur about someone who left their job to pursue their startup. Inspired by their story ‚Äî and in need of design experience ‚Äî I reached out to offer my services for whatever design needs they had, and they tasked me with all their visual and web design projects. </p>
                        <p>LearnSesh, is an EdTech startup, focusing on VR tutoring tools for K-12 students. I rebranded the company, created a design system foundation, and designed/launched their new website. My work included logo design, a lot of surveys to get branding feedback, wireframing, and developing the website in Wordpress.</p>

                <h2>Problem &amp; Research</h2>
                <p>LearnSesh needed to build a new website to ‚Äúwow‚Äù potential customers and investors. Additionally, they wanted their website to include a new brand identity to freshen-up their appearance. They were beginning to get more visibility by media outlets and investors, so we needed to move quickly to get a new site and brand released as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>For my investigation, I first recruited current employees and stakeholders to gather their thoughts about LearnSesh, its mission, identity, and opinions on the current branding. Once I conducted the foundational research, I presented stakeholders with multiple concepts to further identify a design direction, then worked with my coworkers and the Founders to establish the final logo and style guide.</p>

                <p>Through my research I  identified the logo-type most affiliated with LearnSesh to be a graduation hat. I turned to the LearnSesh team to complete a sketching activity where everyone sketches a graduation hat in 3, 5, and 10 second intervals. I used these sketches to create a set of final logos to survey.</p>
                <p>My final questionnaire to stakeholders included four variations of a graduation hat, which they anonymously voted on. Using a combination of the most popular choices and additional opinions about LearnSesh‚Äôs mission, we identified the final logo.</p>

                <h2>Synthesis</h2>
                <p>My findings from the research gave me enough information to choose a path for both logo and styling. After a final survey to stakeholders, it was clear that they wanted to see a logo that represented both virtual reality and ‚Äúthe future‚Äù, along with more approachable, lively colors. The existing design was seen as too ‚Äúserious‚Äù and resembled more of a financial software with its logo and darker color scheme.</p>

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>This was my first time designing a brand and website for an actual company, and was a crash course to digesting design critiques. This opportunity also gave me some insight into ‚Äústart-up life‚Äù and wearing many hats. As the only person with a formal understanding of design, I had to be vocal and intentional about how I approached challenges. Further, working directly with the executive team also served as a great learning experience to improve my ability to storytell and get buy-in for my designs‚Äîand when to compromise to make sure the client feels their voice and identity is reflected in your design.</p>
